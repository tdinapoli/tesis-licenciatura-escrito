  abstract = {There is tremendous disparity in scientific productivity among nations, particularly in Latin America. At first sight, this could be linked to the relative economic health of the different countries of the region, but even large and relatively rich Latin American countries do not produce a good level of science. Although Latin America has increased the number of its scientists and research institutions in recent years, the gap between developed countries and Latin American countries is startling. The prime importance of science and technology to the development of a nation remains unacknowledged. The major factors contributing to low scientific productivity are the limited access to grant opportunities, inadequate budgets, substandard levels of laboratory infrastructure and equipment, the high cost and limited supply of reagents, and inadequate salaries and personal insecurity of scientists. The political and economic instability in several Latin America countries results in a lack of long-term goals that are essential to the development of science. In Latin America, science is not an engine of the economy. Most equipment and supplies are imported, and national industries are not given the incentives to produce these goods at home. It is a pity that Latin American society has become accustomed to expect new science and technological developments to come from developed countries rather than from their own scientists. In this article, we present a critical view of the Latin American investigator's daily life, particularly in the area of biomedicine. Too many bright young minds continue to leave Latin America for developed countries, where they are very successful. However, we still have many enthusiastic young graduates who want to make a career in science and contribute to society. Governments need to improve the status of science for the sake of these young graduates who represent the intellectual and economic future of their countries.},

The use of DIY technology is already widespread, particularly in countries with limited access to science funding, and is catalyzing the development of open-source technologies. Beyond financial accessibility, open hardware can be transformational for the access of laboratories to equipment by reducing dependence on import logistics and enabling direct knowledge transfer. Central drivers to the adoption of appropriate open-source technologies in biology laboratories around the world are open sharing, digital fabrication, local production, the use of standard parts, and detailed documentation. This Essay examines the global spread of open hardware and discusses which kinds of open-source technologies are the most beneficial in scientific environments with economic and infrastructural constraints.},

  abstract = {Literature in environmental science has documented understudied regions, topics, and the underrepresentation of specific groups in the discipline, with significant consequences for research, policy and advocacy. Understanding inequality as a representation problem is valuable but does not necessarily unpack its mechanisms. Using an epistemic justice lens, I look at scientific instruments as sites of inequality by design in environmental studies. Even when in recent years we have seen an explosion of new scientific tools in the field, how these tools reproduce inequalities is underexplored. The open science hardware movement provides an opportunity for studying this question in practice. I present findings from qualitative research with two projects of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community in Latin America during 2018--2022. These findings show how researchers use open science hardware to overcome structural inequalities in environmental research. Beyond their lower cost, researchers are using open hardware to enable new ideas and concepts to emerge through flexible and repairable designs. I describe four mechanisms that enable the creation of new epistemic resources: autonomy, flexibility, impact and resilience, and I identify significant limitations to this potential. In the context of ongoing policy discussions promoting wider adoption of low-cost environmental research tools, this work provides insights for seizing the transformative potential of openness towards more fair environmental science.},

Initially designed to appeal to electronic hobbyists, open electronics have formed a global "maker" community and are increasingly used in science and industry. In this perspective article, we review the current costs and benefits of open electronics for use in scientific research ranging from the experimental to the theoretical sciences. We discuss how user-made electronic applications can help (I) individual researchers, by increasing the customization, efficiency, and scalability of experiments, while improving data quantity and quality; (II) scientific institutions, by improving access to customizable high-end technologies, sustainability, visibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration potential; and (III) the scientific community, by improving transparency and reproducibility, helping decouple research capacity from funding, increasing innovation, and improving collaboration potential among researchers and the public. We further discuss how current barriers like poor awareness, knowledge access, and time investments can be resolved by increased documentation and collaboration, and provide guidelines for academics to enter this emerging field. We highlight that open electronics are a promising and powerful tool to help scientific research to become more innovative and reproducible and offer a key practical solution to improve democratic access to science.},

These include expansions from software into general culture through ‘Free Culture’ movements and, more recently, expansions from software into hardware and design. This article provides a critical perspective on the democratic potential of these broader ‘open’ contribution structures by examining how open source contributions to both software and hardware increase the opportunities for democratic participation in production, governance and knowledge exchange. By analysing attempts to ‘open source’ the sharing of hardware designs, it also notes the limitations of this democratization. The insights developed in the article nuance the relationship between open source cultures and commercial and market structures, identifying how the generative opportunities created by certain aspects of open source contribution structures increase the potential for democratizing production of communication tools, but also how incongruities across different open-source cultures and communities of practice limit the democratic potential of these processes.},

Along with the rapid development of optical technology and nanotechnology, the research of optical sensing methods in agrochemical detection has been developed rapidly owing to its advantages of simplicity, fast response, and cost-effectiveness. In this review, the strategies of employing optical systems based on colorimetric sensor, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, terahertz spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for sensing agrochemicals were summarized. In addition, the challenges in the practical application of optical sensing technologies for agrochemical detection were discussed in-depth, and potential future trends and prospects of these techniques were addressed. A variety of nanomaterials have been developed for enhancing the sensitivity of optical sensing systems. The optical properties of nanomaterials are governed by their size, shape, and chemical structure. Although each optical sensing system holds its advantages, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome in practical applications. With the continuous developments in novel functional nanomaterials, sample preparation methods, and spectral processing algorithms, optical sensors are expected to have powerful potential for rapid testing of agrochemicals in the environment and foods.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) uses the fact that the fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore depends on its molecular environment but not on its concentration. Molecular effects in a sample can therefore be investigated independently of the variable, and usually unknown concentration of the fluorophore. There is a variety of technical solutions of lifetime imaging in microscopy. The technical part of this paper focuses on time-domain FLIM by multidimensional time-correlated single photon counting, time-domain FLIM by gated image intensifiers, frequency-domain FLIM by gain-modulated image intensifiers, and frequency-domain FLIM by gain-modulated photomultipliers. The application part describes the most frequent FLIM applications: Measurement of molecular environment parameters, protein-interaction measurements by F{\"o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), and measurements of the metabolic state of cells and tissue via their autofluorescence. Measurements of local environment parameters are based on lifetime changes induced by fluorescence quenching or conformation changes of the fluorophores. The advantage over intensity-based measurements is that no special ratiometric fluorophores are needed. Therefore, a much wider selection of fluorescence markers can be used, and a wider range of cell parameters is accessible. FLIM-FRET measures the change in the decay function of the FRET donor on interaction with an acceptor. FLIM-based FRET measurement does not have to cope with problems like donor bleedthrough or directly excited acceptor fluorescence. This relaxes the requirements to the absorption and emission spectra of the donors and acceptors used. Moreover, FLIM-FRET measurements are able to distinguish interacting and noninteracting fractions of the donor, and thus obtain independent information about distances and interacting and noninteracting protein fractions. This is information not accessible by steady-state FRET techniques. Autofluorescence FLIM exploits changes in the decay parameters of endogenous fluorophores with the metabolic state of the cells or the tissue. By resolving changes in the binding, conformation, and composition of biologically relevant compounds FLIM delivers information not accessible by steady-state fluorescence techniques.},

	abstract = {The most commonly proposed mechanisms for NIR-to-red upconversion in the well-studied material β-NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ are evaluated in order to resolve inconsistencies that persist in the literature. Each of four possible mechanisms is evaluated in terms of the direct analysis of spectroscopic data. It is shown that there are no important mechanisms that involve the first excited state of Er3+, 4I13/2, as an intermediate state. A large body of evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposed mechanism of Anderson et al., which suggests an intimate connection between NIR-to-red and NIR-to-blue upconversion. Namely, both red and blue upconversion are produced primarily by a three-photon excitation process that proceeds through the green emitting state to a dense manifold of states, 4G/2K, above the blue emitting state, 2H9/2. Competing relaxation mechanisms out of 4G/2K determine the relative amounts of blue and red upconversion produced. Multiphonon relaxation from 4G/2K results in blue upconversion, whereas back energy transfer from Er3+(4G/2K) to Yb3+(2F7/2) results in red emission.},

	abstract = {The expected excitation power dependencies for any upconversion emission band of an acceptor ion is investigated theoretically when the excitation takes place on a sensitizer ion and subsequent energy transfer upconversion from the sensitizer to the acceptor ion is exclusively responsible for the excitation of the acceptor ion. Under these limitations it is shown that emission from a state that requires �� energy transfer upconversion steps will have a slope of �� in the low-power regime when the luminescence intensity is plotted in a double-logarithmic representation versus absorbed pump intensity. In the high-power regime, any emission band will show a slope of 1, irrespective of the number of energy transfer steps from the sensitizer to the acceptor ions that are involved. The theoretical results are verified experimentally by data on three different inorganic systems with different types of sensitizer and acceptor ions: rare earth (RE) ions as well as transition metal (TM) ions. The active ions in the systems that are studied experimentally are RE/RE, RE/TM, and TM/TM, where the first dopant indicates the sensitizer ion and the second dopant indicates the upconverting ion. These different classes of sensitizer and upconverter ions all agree with the theoretical predictions put forward by the model. Thus providing confidence in the applicability (within the boundary conditions put forward here) of the model described.},

	abstract = {© 2019 Upconversion is a common process in lanthanides-based materials in which absorption of multiple low energy photons result in a high energy one. The emission spectrum is frequently tuned by changing the composition of the material. However, a commonly overlooked aspect is the non-linear power dependence which can influence the spectral and temporal properties of the emission. Moreover, as upconverting materials have been shown to increase the output current density in photovoltaic cells when used as spectral converters, the complete power profile is required to calculate the improved efficiency and needs to be incorporated in the design process. In this work, we show that solid β-NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+upconversion nanoparticles, well known for the green–red emission, can also emit efficiently in the UVA–blue range. These bands are often neglected in the literature in nanosized particles despite having promising applications. In addition, we characterized their stationary and dynamic luminescence features as a function of incident power to reveal the relevant intra-band mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the red emission at high incident power is explained by back-energy transfer. Finally, by simultaneously acquiring time resolved decays and power dependent emission slopes, we classified the spectral information to build a visual summary of the system providing a description at a glance of its complex dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: A major problem for current peak detection algorithms is that noise in mass spectrometry (MS) spectra gives rise to a high rate of false positives. The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods.             Results: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, `true' peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a `goodness of fit' coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the 2D CWT coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with SELDI-TOF spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the CWT-based algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low.             Availability: The algorithm is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the Bioconductor project.
